# Is it A Meme or Is it Motivational?

 This part of an exercise from fast.ai's second lesson in which we've trained a deep learning model to classify images as either a motivational quote or a meme.
 This repo allows us to deploy the model using [Binder](https://mybinder.org). 
 
 Interested users can see a working example at the following link:
 
https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/lindbergag/isitamemeorisitmotivational/HEAD?urlpath=%2Fvoila%2Frender%2Fmemeclassifier.ipynb

## Requirements
* Python 3.6+
* voila

1. Clone the repository.
2. Paste the url of that repo into the field on Binder under the heading "Github repository name or URL".
3. Under the heading "Path to a notebook file (optional), change the dropdown from File to URL.
